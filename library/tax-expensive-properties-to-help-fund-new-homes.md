The UK is not building enough houses, London in particular. This point holds by comparison to all of: historic trends, comparator cities in other countries, and the targets set by national / London governments.

There are flaws to UK property taxation, which apply particularly to London:

 - The main property taxes are [Council Tax](https://www.gov.uk/council-tax/working-out-your-council-tax) and [Stamp Duty](https://www.gov.uk/stamp-duty-land-tax-rates). Council Tax is based on property valuations from 1991, since when property price increases have been large on average but divergent across the country. Areas with high property prices increases (disproportionately London) are consequently under taxed compared with original intentions.
 - Stamp duty (a transaction tax) has also seen static price bands, raising more revenue, but also disincentivising mobility.
 - Capital gains are very often untaxed: there is [no tax when the owner is the primary resident](https://www.gov.uk/capital-gains-tax/capital-gains-tax-on-property), and ways around tax even when they are not primary resident. So the vast increases in property prices (again disproportionately in London) remain substantially untaxed.

A logical consequence of devolution in other parts of the UK is legitimacy for London to have more powers.

The most theoretically neat solution to this would be a land value tax (as proposed by Lloyd George over 100 years ago). But a whole new tax would be complex to introduce.

Here is a simpler solution (building from the [Mansion Tax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansion_tax) idea):

 - Introduce an addition to Council Tax, on the most expensive properties in London. Total housing stock in London is estimated at [£1 trillion](http://www.savills.co.uk/_news/article/72418/144360-0/2/2013/uk-housing-stock-value-climbs-£5-000-000-000-000-as-london-becomes-more-dominant).
 - The aim would be to tax the top quartile of value (as defined as the quartile of value held in the most expensive homes).
 - In practical terms this could look like: a 1% annual tax on all house price value above £750,000 (this avoids the lumpy tax rates of Stamp Duty).
 - 20% of revenues go to the national exchequer so all of the UK benefits.
 - The remaining 80% is put in to a Housing Construction Fund to build affordable, shared ownership, and social housing in London.
 - The Greater London Authority receives additional planning powers to direct the building.
 - The tax has a self-correcting element: if property prices go up, the tax base of the top quartile of value goes up and more houses are built; and vice versa.
