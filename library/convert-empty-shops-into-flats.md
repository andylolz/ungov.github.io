title: Convert empty shops into flats
excerpt: The housing shortage can be cushioned by making it easier to convert empty premises above shops into flats. A reduction in business rates for the shop owner should be introduced to incentivise the scheme.

Walk along any high street and you’ll see dingy net curtains or boarded up windows on the first and upper floors - the blank faces of the empty premises behind. When this Ungov contributor worked as a student on one of London’s main shopping streets they discovered three floors of unused dusty rooms above the shop.

At the same time, we’re in a housing crisis, with demand for housing far out-stripping supply, year after year. It seems obvious: why not convert these empty premises to flats? Unfortunately it’s not that easy, as the change of use rules in planning laws make it difficult to switch a building from commercial to partly residential.

This needs to be changed to make it much more attractive for shop owners to convert the empty parts of their premises, or to sell them to developers.

This is not to suggest relaxing the rules to a degree that allows changes to be made indiscriminately - it’s important to protect a single village shop from developers, or to make sure that a residential property can’t be converted to a factory without proper consideration.

In the case of empty premises above shops however, there’s little to lose (perhaps just a tiny bit of local authority power) and much to gain. Not only would the move increase housing supply - and at the affordable end of the market - it would also bring back some life to UK high streets, which can become deserted, particularly in the evenings.

Planning laws should be relaxed so that vacant premises above a shop can automatically be granted a change of use to residential. To give the policy a boost once the change is made an incentive scheme should be introduced for two years that reduces business rates for those shops that make the change.
