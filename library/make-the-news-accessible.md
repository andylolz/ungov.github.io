A huge number of people in the disability community are excluded from current affairs.

While there is a push from many leading disability charities to enable people with learning difficulties to get to the polls in 2015, the information that could potentially inform their decisions remains largely inaccessible.

As a representative of the Disability Allies collective, this Ungov contributor has worked with people with learning difficulties for a long time, in a number of different organisations and sectors. The universal standard of organising written material for our members is the <a href="http://www.easy-read-online.co.uk/what-do-we-do/easy-read-documents.aspx">Easy Read</a> system. This is a way of constructing text that allows people with learning difficulties the chance to access information easily and efficiently.

A revolutionary step for our community would be to entreat the major online providers of British news and opinion (portals like the BBC, as well as the online hubs of broadsheets and tabloids) to provide Easy Read translations of leader articles on their homepages.

It would not be a difficult process. It would, however, open up access for a significant number of peopleÂ to news and opinion across the board. In doing so it would strike at the heart of an enduring prejudice. The prejudice that people with learning difficulties are inherently disconnected from the way the world works and the decisions their leaders take.

With an election looming, providing education and insight to enable the fullest possible franchise is vital. Currently there is one Easy Read newspaper in existence. It comes out every two months. By the time it's released, it's already old news. We can change that.
