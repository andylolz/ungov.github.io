title: Modernise maths education
excerpt: Ubiquitous computer power has changed the way we do maths. It's time for the way we teach maths to catch up - less time spent calculating, more time spent understanding how to ask the right questions and interpret the answers that computers give us.

Science, technology, engineering and maths skills are in high demand, and this will only increase in the years ahead. We are already seeing the beginnings of a welcome renaissance in technology education in our schools, with pioneers like the [Raspberry Pi Foundation](http://www.raspberrypi.org) on a mission to help children learn, and a refresh of the curriculum from IT back to computer science.

[STEM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEM_fields) skills are all underpinned by the ability to think clearly and logically, with maths as a foundational component. For most people, maths is useful not in and of itself, but as a way to solve a problem or gain some insight into the way the world works.

Maths has been taught in broadly the same way for centuries. But recent advances in technology now make something radically better possible.

Using maths to solve a problem involves four stages: get clear on the question you're trying to ask, specify it as a mathematical problem, calculate the answer, and then interpret the answer.

Before the advent of cheap ubiquitous computing power, calculation was the big bottleneck - which is why most of the maths lessons you had at school were spent performing calculations by hand (or perhaps aided by a pocket calculator). This doesn't leave much time to think about which questions to ask - or why - or to evaluate the implications of the answers that came back.

Today we all have ready access to vast computing power. Itâ€™s on our desktops, in our phones and all over the internet. This is a huge opportunity - we can use modern tools and software to take the burden of calculation away, and focus on teaching kids how to ask good questions and critically interpret the answers they get back. Maths lessons will be more relevant than they have ever been, and we will set the country up with a new generation of minds primed to push at the boundaries of science and innovation.
