Everyone has the right to be represented, or to present their case to government, be that local, regional, national or even international.

This includes businesses and large organisations.

However, the right of representation can only be executed fairly if the balance of that representation does not exclude other interested parties that might be affected.

To help achieve this, we could create a law to compel businesses and other large organisations that have lobbying or promotional meetings with government, that sponsor government events, and that contact Civil Servants with the aim of advancing their interests, to provide funding for critical or opposing views and interests to be represented.

A transparency and representation committee could be created to oversee any such balancing of interests and lobbying efforts.

This would guarantee that those who cannot afford to be heard would be provided with an opportunity for their interests to be represented, and the corruption of our democracy by big business would be avoided.
