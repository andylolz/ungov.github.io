title: Guarantee affordable office space
excerpt: Small businesses and startups are priced out of the office space they need to be efficient and productive. All new office developments should be compelled to include affordable office space.

In many instances, where a housebuilder is constructing a new-build development, planning rules require that a significant percentage of available plots are allocated to affordable housing in support of less well off members of the local community.

This Ungov contributor would like to see exactly the same logic applied to commercial office space.

As the CEO of a growing, seed-funded startup, it's difficult to find office space without being priced into the hands of generic storage-unit type premises which are often located in parts of town which are away from where my clients are based. Whilst in the process of relocating our office closer to the centre of town, it's galling to see monthly rents jump by over 400 per cent, forcing us to choose between affordable office space in an inconvenient location, or a convenient location with a reduced budget from which to recruit staff.

In essence, when a new office is built or made available, this contributor believes a small percentage of that office area should be made available to SMEs and startups at a determined reduced rate, to ensure they aren't priced out of more central areas of towns and cities across the UK.
