We’re getting fatter in the UK, which is bad for our health and bad for our pockets. But practical proposals to address the problem meet with resistance about the advance of the nanny state.

This is an emotive argument to make about a straightforward issue of failures in the food and beverages market.

The first failure is the information asymmetry. Most people are overweight because they consume more calories than they expend. This is understandable - it’s hard to work out which foods are ‘good’ and which are ‘bad’ particularly when faced with sophisticated marketing tactics. It’s well known that a soft drink has a high calorie count, but not so obvious that a fruit smoothie can pack such an unhealthy punch.

The market also fails to cover the negative externalities of its transactions - in this case the costs to the NHS. And those costs are large: obesity is projected to cost the NHS - and by extension the taxpayer - £4bn in 2015.

It’s possible to do something about these failures.  UK chief medical officer Sally Davies advocated introduction of a sugar tax in her comments to the health select committee in March this year. A clear price signal discourages consumption of highly calorific food and drink. Revenue raised can be funnelled to the NHS.

This is hardly a new concept. Tobacco tax has long been used to discourage consumption and raise revenue. (It has been argued that both tobacco and sugar taxes are regressive but the data doesn’t show that poverty and obesity are directly linked - see data checkers below.) Other countries have done it already - like France and Mexico. And research shows it would reduce consumption.

Taxes aren’t popular of course, but there was resistance to the idea of a tobacco tax once too. There tends to be more public support for this sort of venture if the revenue raised is used for public health measures. So this Ungov contributor proposes introducing a sugar tax and to, ahem, sweeten the pill, handing over the money raised to the NHS for public health.
