title: Commit to stable tax rules
excerpt: Tax is too complicated. Governments should commit to a clear tax policy roadmap at the start of each parliamentary term, and then restrict themselves to varying only rates and thresholds.

The UK tax system is a complicated mess built on an astonishingly long and impenetrable mass of legislation. We've ended up here because it's too easy to tinker. Successive governments have succumbed to the temptation to introduce and tweak and exempt, often with the best of intentions. But the resulting web of rules only really benefits the lawyers and accountants that the rest of us have to hire to stay the right side of the law.

The ascendance of the Treasury, and the unrelenting pressure of the annual Budget and Autumn Statement, have only served to intensify a cycle that is overwhelmingly driven by the need to find new announcements to feed the machine.

Talk to business leaders and groups, however, and many say (privately) that they would much rather have tax stability than a bunch of wheezes and giveaways that could be reversed at any moment. If the rules were known and guaranteed not to move, then the time and energy and money spent on compliance and contingency planning could be put to much better use.

So here's the solution: within one year of coming to power, each government should draw up a tax roadmap for the remainder of the parliament, based on proposals drawn from the relevant manifesto. Beyond this government would retain the power to vary rates and thresholds, to keep the overall budget on track, but surrender the power to make any structural adjustments to the rules (aside, perhaps, from a tightly drawn backstop power to deal with unanticipated tax evasion).

There is a large lobby of professional advisers who purport to believe in tax simplification, but who would resist this sort of proposal because it would render many of their services unnecessary. That, in and of itself, is a good enough reason to think this proposal is worth pursuing.
