title: Publish an overview of all government databases
excerpt: Government databases are too often a mystery. The government should publish an overview of all of its databases, to increase transparency, cut costs and let the public know who is recording what.

Modern government relies on huge amounts of data, and new databases are continually being created (and existing ones expanded) to sit behind new schemes and policies. These databases can be massively expensive and sometimes duplicate work across government (though on occasion departments do have good reasons not to share their data). More perniciously, as the nature of these databases tends to be opaque, there are increasing concerns about what data is being held, by whom, and for what purpose. 

To cut through this, the government should publish an open, machine-readable description of the structure and contents of every database it pays for (the "schema" in IT jargon). This ought to be administratively simple and would have a number of positive outcomes. It would increase transparency in large IT project spending, make it easier for people to see where efficiencies can be found, stop different departments paying twice for the same thing, and and enable public concerns about data to be debated on the basis of the evidence about what's really happening.
