title: Support SMEs to get paid on time
excerpt: Small and medium enterprises are less able to deal with the impact of a late payment than larger, more established companies. Legislation should be introduced to compel large organisations to pay SMEs on time.

Cashflow is the downfall of many small businesses. It doesn't help that large companies and bodies are so adept at using delaying tactics to slow down payments to smaller suppliers. It's even more shocking when that debtor is a public body or division of government.

As a SME owner (and one who has witnessed friends' and family businesses for several years) this Ungov contributor is constantly chasing clients for payment - often up to 60 days after an invoice is due. Each time the process is predictable: excuses follow excuses, until the accounts department acknowledges sheepishly that it is their job to delay payment for as long as possible.

This is unacceptable. SMEs cannot absorb a late invoice in the same way that a larger organisation or public body can.

To deal with this, we need legislation that will compel large organisations or public bodies (with say over 100 employees or turnover greater than Â£10 million) to pay any SME suppliers (as per HMRC definition) within 30 days of invoice, unless agreed payment terms allow for a longer period.

If we wanted to go further, companies and organisations could be fined for deliberately stalling payment to small suppliers. This would be justified where it hurts the SME supplier hard, and where they have little power against a larger customer.
