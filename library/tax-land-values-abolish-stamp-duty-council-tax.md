A land value tax would be levied on the unimproved value of land, regardless of whether or not it has been developed. Because the supply of land is very inelastic, the economic burden of a land value tax would fall entirely on land owners, with no deadweight loss.

This would be a huge improvement on our current system of property taxation, which is complicated, unfair and massively distortionary. In fact, if we got a land value tax right, it might be possible to do away with things like stamp duty and council tax altogether.

The politics of introducing a land value tax are notoriously difficult. There would be large numbers ofÂ winners and losers, with many wealthy individuals and powerful organisations opposed.
