excerpt: Public sector pensions are unaffordable. We need to break from fiscal short-termism and move towards defined contribution arrangements.

Defined benefit pension arrangements are now almost entirely a feature of the public sector. Although they have been reformed, they remain an anachronistic way to provide retirement benefits. And in the long run, they will still prove unsustainable for the taxpayer (with [liabilities of circa £1 trillion](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/psa/wider-measures-of-public-sector-debt/a-broader-picture-of-the-public-sector-balance-sheet--state-pension-and-other-pension-obligations---update-april-2012/an-update-at-april-2012.htm)), as well as not reflecting what a modern employer would offer in a world where jobs for life are no more.

The solution is to move over to [defined contribution](https://www.gov.uk/workplace-pensions/types-of-workplace-pensions) arrangements, as exist elsewhere, but the Treasury seems to be strangely resistant to this. In this contributor’s view this is simply down to fiscal short termism. It’s true that there would be a decade (or so) of pain during which the government would have to fund and pay for both generations: paying out the pensions of former public sector workers, while also paying into the pension funds of current workers.

However, in the long run this would sort out public sector pensions once and for all, and generate tens of billions of savings.

Over anything other than a short term time horizon this is by far the most sensible thing to do economically, but the fetishisation of (short term) deficit reduction at any (long term) cost seems to make it politically impossible.
