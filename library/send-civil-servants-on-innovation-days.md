The UK Civil Service and many businesses have policies that allow employees to take up to five, or sometimes even more, days a year of special leave to carry out voluntary or charity work.

At a time when we need to encourage growth in the UK economy, and to create an environment in which entrepreneurs can thrive, the Civil Service should consider widening these arrangements to include supporting entrepreneurship or small businesses. Staff could use these innovation days could be used to run a hackathon, to help an entrepreneur put together a funding proposal, or even to get their own small business off the ground.

Google famously allows its employees time to work on their own projects, with great results in developing products that the company has then taken forward commercially. The idea here would be to create an opportunity that’s additional to the volunteering days instead of being a substitute. Different people will want to do different things, and the extra publicity may generate increased take-up for volunteering days as well as for innovation.
