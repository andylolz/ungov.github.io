title: Pay out a true universal credit
excerpt: A universal tax credit should replace most benefits, and be funded by a single rate of income tax. The result would be stronger work incentives, a simpler system, and more equal net incomes.

The UK benefits system is too complicated. A mess of different schemes mean some low paid workers receive less in their pocket for working more hours, while others fear taking short term work will lead to loss of vital benefits. The Coalition has its answer – the Universal Credit. But this replaces one type of complexity with another: it will merge most benefits into a single credit, and then reduce it by 65% of the recipient’s net earnings. This complex tax and benefit calculation will require a new IT system – and the history of big government IT projects suggests this will be a rocky road. Expect more people visiting food banks as the system fails to process payments or cope with changes in time. By combining tax and the 65% taper, the credit also means many workers will see less than a quarter of any additional earnings they make reach their pocket, actually reducing work incentives for many.

A truly radical solution, proposed in the interwar years and adopted as Green Party policy, is a Citizen’s Income – guaranteed income, as of right, for all citizens, at a level to meet all basic needs. But two problems arise – the something for nothing element of an unconditional income will test public support, while the amounts suggested are often unaffordable.

A still bold, but more practical proposal would be a truly Universal Tax Credit. An amount of say £4,500 for all adults in work, actively seeking work, or in education or training, should replace most current benefits (except Housing Benefit, due to the high and variable amounts involved). Credits would be paid to parents for their children and double the standard rate, without conditions, to pensioners and the disabled. To pay for it all income (whether from earnings or savings, inheritance or capital gains) would be taxed at the same constant rate, say 40%, without allowances or deductions. The overall result would be more equal net incomes, a stronger work incentive for all and a far simpler system.
