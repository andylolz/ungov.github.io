title: "New solutions for society"
excerpt: "Ungov is a place for informed people to collaborate on new solutions for society, and for government insiders to find innovative policy proposals."

Far too often, government policy is developed by a small group of people in Westminster, with limited understanding of the areas under consideration. Lobbyists and higher-profile stakeholder groups may be consulted, and the likely press response to any policy announcement is considered, but a huge swathe of human capital is left untapped. 

This untapped capital includes academics and experts - and also people with relevant experience and insights gained from working in public services, businesses or with communities. Without the insight and expertise of this group of informed people, government policies can be ineffective, or even make things worse. And, because the policymaking process lacks transparency, it propagates the disaffection felt by citizens. 

Ungov provides a platform for those informed people to submit smart ideas and collaborate on new solutions - and for government officials and politicians to find new proposals and insights. The team behind Ungov work with the contributors, providing a challenge function and applying a quality filter to test and refine proposals. Then the team uses their networks - developed over two decades in central government - to inject quality assured policy proposals into the heart of the government’s policymaking machine. 

Other policy crowdsourcing endeavours have had limited success - but crowdsourcing can be effective if the ‘crowd’ is well-targeted and there is (transparent) quality assurance. The quality of the content on Ungov, despite it being only seven weeks old, has demonstrated that there truly is wisdom in our crowd. And, as government officials are already following Ungov’s progress with interest, we anticipate that demand for input from that crowd will grow and grow.
