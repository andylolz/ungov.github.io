For a while now, and particularly since the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">Web 2.0</a> era, people have been saying that the practicalities of starting a new venture are easier that ever. Turns out they're right. Having decided to take a crack at getting Ungov off the drawing board, assembling an alpha site itself out of standard web technologies has been pretty straightforward. Here's what we've done:

- Registered our primary domain, for the princely sum of Â£5.99 + VAT
- Built an early prototype using the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) framework
- Established a presence on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ungov.uk) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/5307779)

Not bad for a few hours' work, eh?

The technology is, of course, only a small part of the story. There's lots more to do as we start to build engagement and refine the platform in response to user needs - and this will undoubtedly lead to both the website and the way we work changing and developing significantly over the months ahead. If you've got suggestions for us on any of this then we'd love to hear them.
