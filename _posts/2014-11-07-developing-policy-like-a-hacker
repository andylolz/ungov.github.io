title: Developing policy like a hacker
excerpt: We've added GitHub collboration to our policy library, and everything is awesome.
---

This project is all about finding new, better ways to talk about government policy. We've spent the past few weeks testing out our [policy library pages](http://ungov.uk/library/), uploading some starter content based on the ideas that you have been sending us to see how it works on the web.

We always knew we would need ways for people to work together to improve the ideas that we feature - to confirm where an idea gets it right and point out where it falls short, to sharpen the arguments, to bring data and evidence to bear, and to help figure out the practical setps that would be needed to get it implemented.

We've had comments turned on from the outset, and have recently upgraded from a pretty bare-bones setup to something a bit smarter (powered by [Disqus](http://disqus.com)). The comment forms in place now support replies and nested comments, allow you to vote other people's contributions up or down, and can include images as well as text. Should you wish, you can also log in using your [Twitter](https://twitter.com/), [Facebook](https://facebook.com/) or [Google+](https://plus.google.com/) identity - or as before, leave a comment as a guest without registering.

As well as giving people the chance to comment and discuss the ideas on our site, we wanted to find a way for people to collaborate directly on the content itself. Building a [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki) didn't feel quite right - Ungov is about collaboration but an important part of our offer is validation, and layering a lot of rules on top of a wiki platform felt like a sad thing to do.

After sifting through lots of other options, in the end we've picked a very simple solution.

From today, every page in the policy library includes a link to a corresponding page on GitHub. Anyone can follow this link and propose changes to the source material using the text editor on the GitHub website. Once you're happy with your changes, you can send us a pull request to start a discussion and get your changes incorporated.

We're well aware that GitHub can sound like a scary place for people who aren't computer programmers. But at its heart it's a social network for writing - be that code or anything else. Here are a few things that helped us get started, so if you're curious (and we hope you are) then do have a read.
