title: Getting started
excerpt: Tackling the week one questions - transparency, accountability and protecting our contributors.
---

It's been a busy few days since our concept reveal. We'll be back soon to talk a bit more about where Ungov came from and why we're doing it. In the meantime, contributions for our policy library are coming in already (thank you!), and so are some questions. Things like:

 - How are we going to be transparent whilst protecting people's identities?
 - How are we going to choose which proposals go into our policy library and which ones are rejected?
 - How will we avoid the usual pitfalls when it comes to crowdsourcing?

Here's where we've gotten to so far.

We'll be absolutely transparent about what we - the two of us - are doing. We’ll put any decisions, processes or general musings into this blog or straight onto the relevant bit of the site. If there’s something we’ve missed that you want to know then please tell us so we can respond.

We'll also be transparent about the process for choosing which contributions go into the library. We've started to set out what we'll do when we receive a contribution, and what will guide us to select or reject a proposal.

We're predisposed to accept proposals, as the whole point of Ungov is to provide a platform for crowdsourced ideas rather than one that’s just for the ideas that we agree with. But we will reject proposals that we think are offensive, discriminatory or making a purely party political point. And we're collecting solutions for the policy library, not monologues about what's wrong with the world.

We will always protect the identities of our contributors, because our goal is to provide a safe space for a frank exchange of ideas. We're thinking hard about what we can do to make that commitment more meaningful to people that don't know us.

As for the usual crowdsourcing pitfalls - we'd be very interested to hear about any problems you've experienced in the past, and your advice on how to avoid them.
