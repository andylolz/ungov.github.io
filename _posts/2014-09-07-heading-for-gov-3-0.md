Summer was always going to be a funny time to start a project like this, and day jobs and holidays have meant a quiet couple of weeks on the Ungov front. But things are about to pick up, and in a very good way.

We're thrilled to have joined the [GovLab Academy](https://twitter.com/thegovlab) for their Fall 2014 programme [Solving Public Problems Using Technology](http://thegovlab.org/the-govlab-academys-new-course-can-help-you-solve-problems-that-matter/). This is a new accelerator designed to help students, public servants and entrepreneurs to take public interest projects from inception to implementation.

Our first class focused on the potential opened up by civic technologies and collaboration, and the central importance of defining the problem you want to tackle. Off the back of this we'll be spending some time getting really focused on the problem we want to solve, and our [theory of change](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_change) for converting content and engagement into something that makes a real difference to the lives of the people we care about.

As well as being a great way to drive progress at Ungov, the programme is also a brilliant showcase for how civic technology is changing education. It's a [flipped classroom setup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom), there's a mix of participants [online](https://unhangout.media.mit.edu/how-to-unhangout/) and in-person at the [MIT Media Lab](http://www.media.mit.edu/) and [NYU](http://www.nyu.edu/), and [open badges](http://www.macfound.org/programs/digital-badges/) replace traditional certificates.

One of the programme requirements is for participants to blog about what they're up to and what they're learning, so stay tuned to see how we get on…
