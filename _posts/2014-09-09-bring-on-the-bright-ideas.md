excerpt: "Ungov is not just for policy professionals, it's for anyone with an informed view or a good idea."

We’re delighted that so many people are contacting us with feedback, ideas and suggestions. One question we've been asked repeatedly is whether Ungov is a platform exclusively for policy professionals. For instance, we’ve been contacted by people with long experience in public services, who have great ideas about how those services can be improved, but have held back from setting their idea down in writing because they’re not policy professionals and they don’t know how to compose a ‘policy proposal’.

So we obviously need to make things a bit clearer. Of course Ungov is a platform where a policy professional or academic might make a case for change, backed up with evidence and references. But it’s also a platform where someone with a great idea to improve the area they work in can submit their idea in a line or two. And one of the brilliant things about a collaborative approach to solving policy problems is that other people can then weigh in with their experience or evidence and help to build on that idea further.

We’re about to test our library pages with a couple of the proposals we’ve received so hopefully that will give an indication of the diversity of contributions we’ve received - and once we get the policy library up that should make things clearer still.

In the meantime, if you’ve got a bright idea but you’re just not sure how to write it down then please drop us an email - we’d love to talk to you about it (in confidence of course) and to work out how to get it down in writing and into the policy library.
